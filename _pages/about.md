I am a PhD Student at CU Boulder co-advised by <a href="https://hiro-group.ronc.one/">Professor Alessandro Roncone</a> and <a href="http://cairo-lab.com/">Professor Bradley Hayes</a>. My research interests are in leveraging environment design to enable fluid coordination among human-robot teams.

Previously, I worked with <a href="https://interactive.mit.edu/"> Professor Julie Shah</a> at MIT on flexible assembly lines for human-robot collaboration. I received my Masters in Engineering and Bachelors Degree in Computer Science at MIT in 2018 and 2015 respectively.
